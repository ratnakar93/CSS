    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    
    <blockquote>
        <ol class="C1" >
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
            <br>
            <li>CSS Describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b class="D1" >Css is not neccesary </b><b class="B1" >CSS saves a lot of work.</b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
            <br>
            <li class="I1 U1" >External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <ul class="S1 C1" >
            <li>Inline - by using the style attributes inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by suing a link elemnt to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep styles in external CSS files. However, <b class="B1" >in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>

    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>

    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
